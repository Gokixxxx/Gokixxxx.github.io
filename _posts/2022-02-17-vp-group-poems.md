> wyx : 比赛响起爆零的讯号
在他生涯里
仿佛带点唏嘘
平庸天赋给他的意义
是一生奉献
内卷斗争中
强基把拥有变作失去
fys : 疲倦的代码带着Bug
qyc : 今天只有n!^8的爆力
迎接爆零岁月
切队长随手阿克
一生经过彷徨的挣扎
自信可改变oi
问谁又能做到

——wyx《爆零岁月》

强基把拥有变作失去!

今天只有n!^8的爆力!

不行了，太牛逼了（

我觉得fys那一句改成 带着fuck 比较有趣，但是还是太奇怪了（

改变oi 的另一个想法是 改变一中，指的是wyx的学校tayz~~(疼爱yz。yz是sn的ag选手，现在高三)~~。显然wyx必将make tayz great again/se

如果真的要唱，请注意 bug 是 八哥，n!^8 是 摁八，oi 是 nOu naI。有人还记得 Nen nOu naI吗（

> wyx: The contest ended in a boom of 0
and his OI career
ended in a sigh.
He spent his whole youth
in involuting, involuting
because of his ordinariness.
Hydroxyl made him a loser.
fys: His code is tired, having many bugs!
qyc: Today I only have brute force of n!^8!
I will boom 0 happily
but Mr.Eight AKed easily.
I have felt confused and lost before
I will fight on, for changing OI
but can anyone?

感觉英文版很有感觉。但是朗诵起来是个什么东西（

I have felt confused and lost before. I will fight on, for changing OI, but, can anyone?

qyc : 赛前十年功

/hanx，正叔打abc，赛后一分钟切了忘了哪个题了，然后就吟了这么一句诗，然后我就给金句了（
